#  Using the concepts of Reinforcement learning to train a system agent to play the Snak game.

## Introduction:
Our project is based on the concept of reinforcement learning, in which we are training our ML model to play the famous snake game. Initially, the model performs very inaccurately and inconsistently. But, as the model plays more games, the accuracy and consistancy keeps increasing.


## Problem Statement:
--pass--

## Goal:
Our aim was to successfully use the concept of reinforcement learning and train AI to learn the constraints of the snake game and play the game accurately.

## Tech Stack:
* Pygame
* Pytorch
* --(fill this subhash)--

## How to Run:
* Make sure all the files in the repository remain in the same folder/repository.
* Run the "agent.py" file.
* The pygame window will pop up.
* Let the model for some time.
* You can then see the progress in the graph that is plotted based on the number of points scored per game by the model.
* --(beautify)--

## Applications:
Our idea can further be extended to make AI play other games and find an accurate way to finish the game with a high score.

## Further Improvements:
* We could have had a better UI for the game.
* We could have added other elements like bonus points or score multipliers etc. to make the game more fun.
* We could have implemented the model such that it was more accurate in its moves.
